Moreover, comments on general topics relevant to toxicology are welcome, such as legislation or funding policy.

Nevertheless, the editorial board ask that the submissions adhere to the following standards:- They should be sound, scientifically-founded and of general interest- Critical contributions are welcome; however, ad hominem reasoning must be avoided.- They should be no more than 1 printed page long, without an abstract, figures or tables. We accept a maximum of three references, and ask for short affiliations only (institute and country, no address).If a letter or guest editorial addresses an article published in our journal, the corresponding author of that article will be invited to contribute a response letter. If the response is received within four weeks after the invitation is made, both the original opinion piece and the response letter will be published back to back in the same issue. If however, the response is received later than the allotted four weeks, it will be published as soon as it is technically feasible in a subsequent issue.

JEK,eLife,YES,Research Advance,"Research Advances
This format is for substantial developments that directly build upon a Research Article, Short Report or Tools and Resources article published previously by eLife. A Research Advance can be submitted by some or all of the authors of the original paper and/or researchers who were not involved in the original paper. A Research Advance might use a new technique or a different experimental design to generate results that build upon the conclusions of the original research by, for example, providing new mechanistic insights or extend the pathway under investigation. Research Advances can also report significant improvements to experimental tools and techniques.

Research Advances can be of any length, and any number of main display items, but there may only need to be minimal introductory material. Authors have flexibility in the format, for example with a combined Results and Discussion section, and there is no need for a detailed Materials and Methods section when the methods are the same as the original paper. Authors should upload a completed version of the Transparent Reporting Form (PDF; Word) to accompany their submission.

When published, Research Advances are linked to the original article, and they are indexed and citable in their own right. When the authors of the original article are not involved in the Research Advance, the corresponding author of the original study will be asked for comments during the review process. Where appropriate, the Research Advance will be considered by the same editors and reviewers who were involved in the assessment of the original paper.",NOT STATED,NOT STATED,NOT STATED,NOT STATED,YES (opens another page),Scientific Correspondence,"Scientific Correspondence
This format should be used for a manuscript that challenges the central findings of a paper published in eLife, and for the formal response to such a manuscript. In the first instance, the author must contact the corresponding author of the original eLife paper in an effort to resolve matters (and include evidence of these efforts in their initial submission). Scientific Correspondence must also be submitted within a year of the original eLife paper being published.

The title of the manuscript should be 'Comment on 'Title of original article' ', and it should be written in a measured tone; manuscripts not written in measured tone will be sent back to the authors for revision: please read this blogpost for more information.

Where possible, the initial submission is considered by the Senior Editor and the Reviewing Editor who handled the original paper (and by others if necessary). In the first instance the Editors will decide if any of the issues raised in the initial submission require a formal Correction to the original article: if a correction is required, the corresponding author of the original paper will be contacted and the Scientific Correspondence will be put on hold until the Correction has been finalized. If a Correction is published and discrepancies between the original paper and the challenge remain, the authors of the Scientific Correspondence will be asked to revise their submission accordingly.

If the Editors agree that the initial submission represents a credible challenge to the central findings of the original paper, a full submission is invited; the initial submission is also sent to the authors of the original paper and they are given 14 days to submit a formal response (which may be shared with the authors of the challenge at some stage in the process). If the initial submission does not represent a credible challenge to the original paper, it is declined.

Once any response has been received, the Editors discuss the challenge and the response, and then decide between the following options: accept both for publication; accept the challenge but reject the response; reject both; proceed with peer review of one or both manuscripts; take another course of action.

If the Editors opt for peer review, the following outcomes are possible: the challenge and the response are both accepted; the challenge is accepted but the response is rejected; the challenge is rejected (which means there is no need to publish the response). Please note the manuscripts will typically be accepted or rejected at this stage of the process; revised manuscripts will not usually be requested.

Full submissions and formal responses should not usually exceed 1,500 words in the main text, excluding the Materials and methods, References, and Figure legends, and should have no more than four main display items (figures, tables, videos). Authors should follow the format for Research Articles or Short Reports, as appropriate; the Results and/or Discussion section should contain separate subsections for each element of the challenge. Both the challenge and the response can contain original data.

While priority is given to manuscripts that challenge eLife papers, we will also consider important submissions that challenge papers published elsewhere. As described above, the author must contact the corresponding author of the original paper in an effort to resolve matters (and include evidence of these efforts in their initial submission), and the Scientific Correspondence must be submitted within a year of the original paper being published.","YES (provide number of words/comments below), 1500","YES (provide detail of time limits below), within a year of the original publication","references are included in the 1500 word limit, but no specific number of references","it may be, the editors decide",NO (submits form),"NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"

The title of the manuscript should be 'Comment on 'Title of original article' ', and it should be written in a measured tone; manuscripts not written in measured tone will be sent back to the authors for revision: please read this blogpost for more information.

Where possible, the initial submission is considered by the Senior Editor and the Reviewing Editor who handled the original paper (and by others if necessary). In the first instance the Editors will decide if any of the issues raised in the initial submission require a formal Correction to the original article: if a correction is required, the corresponding author of the original paper will be contacted and the Scientific Correspondence will be put on hold until the Correction has been finalized. If a Correction is published and discrepancies between the original paper and the challenge remain, the authors of the Scientific Correspondence will be asked to revise their submission accordingly.

If the Editors agree that the initial submission represents a credible challenge to the central findings of the original paper, a full submission is invited; the initial submission is also sent to the authors of the original paper and they are given 14 days to submit a formal response (which may be shared with the authors of the challenge at some stage in the process). If the initial submission does not represent a credible challenge to the original paper, it is declined.

Once any response has been received, the Editors discuss the challenge and the response, and then decide between the following options: accept both for publication; accept the challenge but reject the response; reject both; proceed with peer review of one or both manuscripts; take another course of action.

If the Editors opt for peer review, the following outcomes are possible: the challenge and the response are both accepted; the challenge is accepted but the response is rejected; the challenge is rejected (which means there is no need to publish the response). Please note the manuscripts will typically be accepted or rejected at this stage of the process; revised manuscripts will not usually be requested.

Full submissions and formal responses should not usually exceed 1,500 words in the main text, excluding the Materials and methods, References, and Figure legends, and should have no more than four main display items (figures, tables, videos). Authors should follow the format for Research Articles or Short Reports, as appropriate; the Results and/or Discussion section should contain separate subsections for each element of the challenge. Both the challenge and the response can contain original data.

While priority is given to manuscripts that challenge eLife papers, we will also consider important submissions that challenge papers published elsewhere. As described above, the author must contact the corresponding author of the original paper in an effort to resolve matters (and include evidence of these efforts in their initial submission), and the Scientific Correspondence must be submitted within a year of the original paper being published.","YES (provide number of words/comments below), 1500","YES (provide detail of time limits below), within a year of the original publication","references are included in the 1500 word limit, but no specific number of references","it may be, the editors decide",YES (opens another page),Annotations,"Use Hypothesis to make notes on any of the content on the eLife website.

This type of commentary discusses specific issues within a subject area rather than the whole field, explains the implications of the article and puts it in context. Opinions are welcome as long as they are factually based. The second form is more editorial in nature and covers an aspect of an issue that is relevant to the journal's scope. Examples of this type of commentary could be a discussion of the impact of new technology on research and treatment, or a discussion of changes in peer review or grant application procedures and their effect on research.

The second type (New-Data Letter) may report new, concise findings that are not appropriate for publication as Research Articles.

Letters may be no more than 500 words long and must be typed double-spaced. Refer to a recently published Letter for correct formatting. Note that authors and affiliations are listed below the title.

All Letters to the Editor must be submitted electronically, and the type of Letter (New Data or Comment) must be selected from the choices in the submission form. For Letters commenting on published articles, the cover letter should state the volume and issue in which the article was published, the title of the article, and the last name of the first author. Letters to the Editor do not have abstracts. Both types of Letter must have a title, which must appear on the manuscript and on the submission form. Figures and tables should be kept to a minimum.

The first type (Comment Letter) is intended for comments on final, typeset articles published in the journal (not on accepted manuscripts posted online) and must cite published references to support the writer's argument. The second type (New-Data Letter) may report new, concise findings that are not appropriate for publication as Research Articles.

Letters may be no more than 500 words long and must be typed double-spaced. Refer to a recently published Letter for correct formatting. Note that authors and affiliations are listed below the title.

All Letters to the Editor must be submitted electronically, and the type of Letter (New Data or Comment) must be selected from the choices in the submission form. For Letters commenting on published articles, the cover letter should state the volume and issue in which the article was published, the title of the article, and the last name of the first author. Letters to the Editor do not have abstracts. Both types of Letter must have a title, which must appear on the manuscript and on the submission form. Figures and tables should be kept to a minimum.

TB,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS,YES,Commentaries,"Commentaries provide readers with context on a recent publication or meeting, a notable anniversary or event, an update on a paper of importance, or special collection in an AGU or other journal. Commentaries are submitted to a specific journal but the audience is the broad Earth and space science community. The maximum length is up to six publication units and up to two tables or figures. Read our author guidelines on commentaries.

About AGU Commentaries 
Commentaries may be invited by a journal Editor or submitted unsolicited at any time. They should
provide reflections or context around one or more of the following:
• A recent article(s) or special collection in an AGU or another journal
• An emerging or controversial topic in a specific scientific field
• A scientific topic with societal implications
• A recent meeting, session, or workshop
• An update of a classic, historical, or highly cited article or special collection
• An anniversary or other notable event
Although submitted to a specific journal, a Commentary’s audience is the broad Earth and space
science community.
There are no publication fees for Commentaries and they are free access once published under any
license type. Authors are under no obligation to sign an open access license unless required to do
so by funder or institution policy, or by personal preference, in which case standard charges for
open access licenses will apply. 

Format and style
• Commentaries have a maximum length of 6 publication units (one publication unit = 500
words or 1 figure or table; references are excluded). A typical length is ~2000 words and 1-2
figures. Exceptions may be arranged by contacting the journal Editor.
• We encourage a title that is short and interesting. “Commentary on Paper X by Author Y” is
not an acceptable title.
• Include a brief ~100-word Abstract.
• If the Commentary is about another article, a citation must be included in the Abstract and
will be hyperlinked on publication.
• We strongly encourage inclusion of a Plain Language Summary.
• The first paragraph(s) should provide background to set the context for the general reader.
• Specific results should be described within the body of the Commentary, emphasizing the
broader understanding that is emerging through this and related work.
• When referring to another published article, it is acceptable to include appropriate or brief
criticisms and/or identification of key assumptions or uncertainties; however, a
Commentary should not be, nor take the place of, a detailed technical comment. 

The final paragraph(s) should identify suggestions for further work or unanswered
questions. Drawing out the societal relevance of the topic is strongly encouraged.
• Throughout, write in an accessible way and avoid technical jargon so that it can be
understood by a non-specialist.
• If possible, provide a schematic illustration or figure that summarizes the main concept or
issue being highlighted in the commentary.
• References should follow AGU style. 
",YES (provide number of words/comments below),NOT STATED,NOT STATED,NOT STATED,YES (opens another page),COMMENT AND REPLY,"These papers elaborate on or criticize papers previously published in our journals. Comments are limited to two published pages (about five publishing units). Please review our Comment and Reply policy page for more information on the comment and reply process. Comments and replies are not allowed in Geophysical Research Letters. 

Replies are written in response to comments by the authors of the paper being commented on. Replies are limited to five publication units). Please review our Comment and Reply policy page for more information on the comment and reply process. Comments and replies are not allowed in GRL.

COMMENT AND REPLY POLICY
AGU journals will consider for publication comments on papers that have previously appeared in the journal. The editor of the journal determines whether a comment meets the standards for publication and may elect to decline a comment without further consideration or require revisions before further consideration. If the editor decides to go forward with consideration of a comment, a reply by the author of the paper commented upon will also be considered for publication. Both comments and replies will be refereed to ensure that the comment addresses significant aspects of the original paper without becoming essentially a new paper; the reply responds directly to the comment without becoming evasive; and
the tone of each is appropriate for a scientific journal.
A comment will first be sent to the author of the original paper, who will be given the opportunity to write a reply. Normally, the editor will provide a deadline for receipt of the reply in order to assure prompt publication of the discussion. If a reply is submitted in a timely way, the editor will have both the comment and reply reviewed. If the original author chooses not to submit a reply or is unwilling to respond within the time frame set by the editor, the editor may elect to proceed without a reply.

In most cases, only one referee will be used. The referee will be asked to prepare separate reports on the comment and reply. (If the author of the original paper did not reply, the comment will be reviewed and a decision concerning publication will be made after the referee’s report has been received.)

Upon receipt of the referee’s reports, the editor will forward the reply, along with the referee’s report on the comment, to the author of the comment. The comment may be revised one time in response to the reply and the referee’s report. The revised comment will then be sent, together with the referee’s report of the reply, to the authors of the reply. One revision of the reply will be allowed.

At this point, a final decision will be made whether or not to publish the comment and the reply. If it is decided to proceed with publication, both the comment and reply will appear in the same issue of the journal (i.e., will be posted online on the same day). Both authors will receive copies of the final manuscripts before publication.

A strict limit equivalent to 4 printed pages will be adhered to for both comments and replies.","YES (provide number of words/comments below), 2500 (5 publication units of 500 words each)",NOT STATED,NOT STATED,YES,NO (submits form),"NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"

formatted using the JMSJ word template) that describe original findings as either an “Express Note”
or a “Comment and Reply”. Comments on papers published in JMSJ, and any responses from the

of review processes.

Guidelines for Notes and Correspondence, JMSJ
Feb. 13, 2019
Description
In addition to Articles, JMSJ publishes Notes and Correspondence, which are shorter
articles that deserve rapid publication. They report novel scientific discoveries or technical
developments that clearly advance understanding in meteorology and related sciences.
Notes and Correspondence describe original findings in up to 4,500 words
(approximately 15 pages when formatted using the JMSJ word template) and are published as
either an “Express Note” or a “Comment and Reply”. Comments on papers published in JMSJ,
and any responses from the authors of those papers, are included in the latter subtype. Notes and
Correspondence are intended to be published rapidly, with a full but expedited peer review process
in which the final editorial decision on their suitability for publication will be made within 4
months of submission.
Review Process
JMSJ aims to complete the peer review process of Notes and Correspondence from
submission to final decision within 4 months. As such, authors are offered one opportunity to
revise the manuscript after the initial reviewers’ comments, and revised manuscripts are not
generally sent for re-review. Instead, the editor makes an assessment and proposes a decision to
the Editorial Committee, which makes the final decision to accept or reject.
The full review process is as follows: First, the editor makes an initial assessment of the
manuscript and decides whether it should be sent to reviewers. If the editor decides to send the
manuscript out for peer review, two or more reviewers are invited and asked to return their reviews
within 3 weeks. The editor then assesses the reviews and the manuscript, and makes a first
decision: accept, reject or revision.
When authors are invited to revise their manuscript, the editor outlines the major items
needing revision and includes the reviews as sent by the reviewers. Unless otherwise agreed,
revisions must be received from authors within 3 weeks or the manuscript will be rejected.
Given the nature of Notes and Correspondence, the journal generally allows authors to
revise the manuscript only once. When revised manuscripts are received, the editor assesses
whether the reviewers’ comments have been addressed appropriately and proposes a decision to
the Editorial Committee, which makes the final decision to accept or reject the manuscript.
Revised manuscripts are rarely sent for re-review. In some cases, the editor may make queries or
request further minor modifications to revised manuscripts.
If the required revisions are deemed to be time-consuming and major, but there is some
prospect of the manuscript becoming suitable for publication in JMSJ, the editor may invite the
author to convert the manuscript to an Article and continue the review process. If authors resubmit
a manuscript, the authors must respond to the reviewers’ comments when re-submitting. Where
possible, the editor will invite the original reviewers to re-review the revised manuscript.
To Authors:
Authors of Notes and Correspondence must clearly and concisely describe the novel
scientific discoveries or important technical developments. In particular, it is vital to clearly state
what is novel or important. Manuscript that are ambiguous or unclear in this regard are rarely
accepted. Given the nature of Notes and Correspondence, the journal generally allows authors to
revise the manuscript only once. Revised manuscripts are not sent for re-review but rather are
assessed by the editor.
To Reviewers:
The journal requests that reviewers assess the manuscript in light of the main purpose
of Notes and Correspondence, which is to present truly novel scientific discoveries or technical
developments. As such, it is undesirable to require the author to add more work than necessary.
Instead, reviewers should assess the novelty and importance of the work presented. In principle,
the manuscript for Notes and Correspondence can be revised only once by the author, and the
revised manuscripts are not sent for re-review. If this manuscript needs second review, it might
be moved to the normal “Article” category.
To Editors:
The journal aims to complete the peer review process from submission to final decision
within 4 months. The editor is responsible for undertaking the review process of Notes and
Correspondence within this time. JMSJ asks editors to inform the reviewers that when assessing
manuscripts, they should pay particular attention to the main purpose of Notes and
Correspondence, which is to present truly novel scientific discoveries or technical developments.
The editor is also requested to inform the authors that revisions can generally be made only once,
and that the editor will make a decision on the revised manuscript without sending it for further
review.","YES (provide number of words/comments below), 4500 words",NOT STATED,NOT STATED,YES,NO (submits form),"NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"

TB,JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,YES,Letters to the Editor,"Two types of Letters to the Editor may be submitted. The first type (Comment Letter) is intended for comments on final, typeset articles published in the journal (not on accepted manuscripts posted online) and must cite published references to support the writer's argument. The second type (New-Data Letter) may report new, concise findings that are not appropriate for publication as Research Articles.

Letters may be no more than 500 words long and must be typed double-spaced. Refer to a recently published Letter for correct formatting. Note that authors and affiliations are listed below the title.

All Letters to the Editor must be submitted electronically, and the type of Letter (New Data or Comment) must be selected from the choices in the submission form. For Letters commenting on published articles, the cover letter should state the volume and issue in which the article was published, the title of the article, and the last name of the first author. Letters to the Editor do not have abstracts. Both types of Letter must have a title, which must appear on the manuscript and on the submission form. Figures and tables should be kept to a minimum.

If the Letter is related to a published article, it will be sent to the editor who handled the article in question. The letter will be sent for peer review. If the editor believes that publication is warranted, he/she will solicit a reply from the corresponding author of the article and make a recommendation to the editor in chief. Final approval for publication rests with the editor in chief.

New-Data Letters will be assigned to an editor according to subject matter and will be sent for peer review by that editor. After review, the editor will send a recommendation to the editor in chief. Final approval for publication rests with the editor in chief.

Nature Chemical Biology does not consider Matters Arising on papers published in other journals.

Contributions that do not comply with our submission criteria (see sections below) will not be considered.

Manuscript preparation and formatting
Manuscripts (both Matters Arising and Replies) should be formatted according to these instructions.

The main text should be as concise as possible, and ideally not exceed 1,200 words. Any extended Methods may be reported as Supplementary Information.
Contributions should start with a brief paragraph that summarizes the message of the article without specialized terminology, for a non-specialist readership. This paragraph should be used as the abstract for submission purposes.
Contributions should have a simple message that ideally requires only one or two small figures or tables. Complex figures or tables may be presented as Extended Data items (ideally no more than three such items).
At submission, figures should be of sufficient quality to be assessed by referees, ideally as JPEGs.
As a guideline, contributions may have up to 15 references; reference style is as for Articles.
Supplementary Information is permitted at the editor's discretion.
A competing interests statement is required.
An author contributions statement is required.
Before peer review, authors of life sciences contributions that include new data must provide details about elements of experimental and analytical design and must provide a completed reporting summary that will be made available to editors and reviewers during manuscript assessment. The reporting summary will be published with all accepted contributions.
Before peer review, the corresponding author must complete an editorial policy checklist to ensure compliance with Nature Research editorial policies. Please note: because of the advanced features used in these forms, you must use Adobe Reader to open the documents and fill them out. Guidance and resources related to the use and reporting of statistics are available here.
Submissions
Contributions should be submitted using the online submission service.

Before submitting, all contributors must agree to all of Nature's publication policies.

In addition:

All contributions should be measured in tone, and should not contain inflammatory or otherwise intemperate language.
Comments should ideally have been sent to the authors of the paper under discussion before submission to Nature Chemical Biology, so that disputes can be resolved directly whenever possible and points on which both parties agree removed from the submitted contribution. If an attempt to contact the original authors has been unsuccessful (for example, no response received after two weeks), this should be indicated at submission.
Any correspondence should accompany the submission as an attachment clearly labelled as ‘Correspondence with the Nature Chemical Biology authors'.
Editorial Process
The editors will decide how to proceed on the basis of the potential interest to readers, importance and timeliness of the contribution.

Matters Arising submissions that meet Nature Chemical Biology's initial selection criteria are sent to the authors of the original paper for a formal response. The comments and formal response may then be sent to independent referees.

A Reply is published only when it adds to the debate, and not when it reiterates points already published. It should be confined to replying to the specific issue raised about the published paper.

Authors of the original Nature Chemical Biology publication must keep the information provided in Matters Arising confidential and must not use it for their own research or for any other purpose apart from replying to the comment, nor can they distribute it without first obtaining Nature Chemical Biology's permission.

We will not consider appeals against decisions not to publish Matters Arising unless the grounds for appeal consist of a previously overlooked and important scientific point and are clearly explained in these terms. Authors who have had a submission declined are encouraged to post it as an online comment to the paper concerned at the journal's website and/or on an appropriate preprint server.","YES (provide number of words/comments below), 1200",NOT STATED,"YES (provide number of references below), 15",YES,NO (submits form),"NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"

The main text should be as concise as possible, and ideally not exceed 1,200 words. Any extended Methods may be reported as Supplementary Information.
Contributions should start with a brief paragraph that summarizes the message of the article without specialized terminology, for a non-specialist readership. This paragraph should be used as the abstract for submission purposes.
Contributions should have a simple message that ideally requires only one or two small figures or tables. Complex figures or tables may be presented as Extended Data items (ideally no more than three such items).
At submission, figures should be of sufficient quality to be assessed by referees, ideally as JPEGs.
As a guideline, contributions may have up to 15 references; reference style is as for Articles.
Supplementary Information is permitted at the editor's discretion.

Submissions
Contributions should be submitted using the online submission service.

Before submitting, all contributors must agree to all of Nature's publication policies.

In addition:

All contributions should be measured in tone, and should not contain inflammatory or otherwise intemperate language.
Comments should ideally have been sent to the authors of the paper under discussion before submission to Nature Medicine, so that disputes can be resolved directly whenever possible and points on which both parties agree removed from the submitted contribution. If an attempt to contact the original authors has been unsuccessful (for example, no response received after two weeks), this should be indicated at submission.
Any correspondence should accompany the submission as an attachment clearly labelled as ‘Correspondence with the Nature Medicine authors'.
Editorial Process
The editors will decide how to proceed on the basis of the potential interest to readers, importance and timeliness of the contribution.

Matters Arising submissions that meet Nature Medicine's initial selection criteria are sent to the authors of the original paper for a formal response. The comments and formal response may then be sent to independent referees.

A Reply is published only when it adds to the debate, and not when it reiterates points already published. It should be confined to replying to the specific issue raised about the published paper.

Authors of the original Nature Medicine publication must keep the information provided in Matters Arising confidential and must not use it for their own research or for any other purpose apart from replying to the comment, nor can they distribute it without first obtaining Nature Medicine's permission.

We will not consider appeals against decisions not to publish Matters Arising unless the grounds for appeal consist of a previously overlooked and important scientific point and are clearly explained in these terms. Authors who have had a submission declined are encouraged to post it as an online comment to the paper concerned at the journal's website and/or on an appropriate preprint server.","YES (provide number of words/comments below), 1200","YES (provide detail of time limits below), These comments should ideally be based on knowledge contemporaneous with the original paper, rather than subsequent scientific developments.","YES (provide number of references below), 15",YES,NO (submits form),"NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"

These comments should ideally be based on knowledge contemporaneous with the original paper, rather than subsequent scientific developments.

If the submission serves only to identify an important error or mistake in the published paper, it will usually lead to the publication of a clarification statement (correction or retraction, for example). Please contact medicine@us.nature.com for these cases.

In all cases, Nature Medicine strongly encourages correspondents to first contact the authors of the paper directly, as this can often resolve matters if they arise from a simple misunderstanding.

Matters Arising and Replies are bi-directionally linked with the original published paper.

General information
Nature Research journals recognize the importance of post-publication commentary on published research as necessary to advancing scientific discourse. Formal post-publication commentary on published papers can involve either challenges or clarifications of the published work and may, after peer review, be published online as Matters Arising, usually alongside a Reply from the original Nature Physics authors. Matters Arising are exceptionally interesting and timely scientific comments and clarifications on original research papers published in Nature Physics. These comments should ideally be based on knowledge contemporaneous with the original paper, rather than subsequent scientific developments.

If the submission serves only to identify an important error or mistake in the published paper, it will usually lead to the publication of a clarification statement (correction or retraction, for example). Please contact naturephysics@nature.com for these cases.

In all cases, Nature Physics strongly encourages correspondents to first contact the authors of the paper directly, as this can often resolve matters if they arise from a simple misunderstanding.

Matters Arising and Replies are bi-directionally linked with the original published paper.

Nature Physics does not consider Matters Arising on papers published in other journals.

Contributions that do not comply with our submission criteria (see sections below) will not be considered.

Manuscript preparation and formatting
Manuscripts (both Matters Arising and Replies) should be formatted according to these instructions.

The main text should be as concise as possible, and ideally not exceed 1,200 words. Any extended Methods may be reported as Supplementary Information.
Contributions should start with a brief paragraph that summarizes the message of the article without specialized terminology, for a non-specialist readership. This paragraph should be used as the abstract for submission purposes.
Contributions should have a simple message that ideally requires only one or two small figures or tables. Complex figures or tables may be presented as Extended Data items (ideally no more than three such items).
At submission, figures should be of sufficient quality to be assessed by referees, ideally as JPEGs.
As a guideline, contributions may have up to 15 references; reference style is as for Articles.
Supplementary Information is permitted at the editor's discretion.
A competing interests statement is required.
An author contributions statement is required.
Before peer review, the corresponding author must complete an editorial policy checklist to ensure compliance with Nature Research editorial policies. Please note: because of the advanced features used in these forms, you must use Adobe Reader to open the documents and fill them out. Guidance and resources related to the use and reporting of statistics are available here.
Submissions
Contributions should be submitted using the online submission service.

Before submitting, all contributors must agree to all of Nature's publication policies.

In addition:

All contributions should be measured in tone, and should not contain inflammatory or otherwise intemperate language.
Comments should ideally have been sent to the authors of the paper under discussion before submission to Nature Physics, so that disputes can be resolved directly whenever possible and points on which both parties agree removed from the submitted contribution. If an attempt to contact the original authors has been unsuccessful (for example, no response received after two weeks), this should be indicated at submission.
Any correspondence should accompany the submission as an attachment clearly labelled as ‘Correspondence with the Nature Physics authors'.
Editorial Process
The editors will decide how to proceed on the basis of the potential interest to readers, importance and timeliness of the contribution.

Matters Arising submissions that meet Nature Physics's initial selection criteria are sent to the authors of the original paper for a formal response. The comments and formal response may then be sent to independent referees.

A Reply is published only when it adds to the debate, and not when it reiterates points already published. It should be confined to replying to the specific issue raised about the published paper.

Authors of the original Nature Physics publication must keep the information provided in Matters Arising confidential and must not use it for their own research or for any other purpose apart from replying to the comment, nor can they distribute it without first obtaining Nature Physics's permission.

We will not consider appeals against decisions not to publish Matters Arising unless the grounds for appeal consist of a previously overlooked and important scientific point and are clearly explained in these terms. Authors who have had a submission declined are encouraged to post it as an online comment to the paper concerned at the journal's website and/or on an appropriate preprint server.","YES (provide number of words/comments below), 1200",NOT STATED,"YES (provide number of references below), 15",YES,NO (submits form),"NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"

TB,npj Biofilms and Microbiomes,YES,Matters Arising,"General information
Nature Research journals recognize the importance of post-publication commentary on published research as necessary to advancing scientific discourse. Formal post-publication commentary on published papers can involve either challenges, clarifications or in some cases, replication of the published work and may, after peer review, be published online as Matters Arising, usually alongside a Reply from the original npj Biofilms and Microbiomes authors.

Matters Arising are exceptionally interesting and timely scientific comments and clarifications on original research papers published in npj Biofilms and Microbiomes. These comments should ideally be based on knowledge contemporaneous with the original paper, rather than subsequent scientific developments.

If the submission serves only to identify an important error or mistake in the published paper, it will usually lead to the publication of a clarification statement (correction or retraction, for example). Please contact npj Biofilms and Microbiomes for these cases.

In all cases, npj Biofilms and Microbiomes strongly encourages correspondents to first contact the authors of the paper directly as this can often resolve matters if it is a simple misunderstanding.

Matters Arising and Replies are bidirectionally linked with the original published paper. npj Biofilms and Microbiomes does not consider Matters Arising on papers published in other journals. Contributions that do not comply with our submission criteria (see sections below) will not be considered.

Manuscript preparation and formatting
Before submission, correspondents may wish to read some previous contributions to see whether their contribution seems appropriate.

Manuscripts (both Matters Arising and Replies) should be formatted according to these instructions.

The main text should be as concise as possible, and ideally not exceed 1,200 words.
Contributions should start with a brief paragraph that summarizes the message of the article without specialized terminology, for a non-specialist readership. This paragraph should be used as the abstract for submission purposes.
Contributions should have a simple message that ideally requires only one or two small figures or tables.
At submission, figures should be of sufficient quality to be assessed by referees, ideally as JPEGs.
As a guideline, contributions may have up to 15 references; reference style is as for Articles.
Supplementary Information is permitted at the editor's discretion.
A competing interests statement is required.
An author contributions statement is required.
To improve the transparency of reporting and the reproducibility of published results in certain other research areas, authors in certain disciplines may be asked to complete a reporting summary and provide the requested information prior to peer review. Further details on this can be found here.
Submissions
Contributions should be submitted using the online submission service.

Before submitting, all contributors must agree to all Nature Research publication policies.

In addition:

All contributions should be measured in tone, and should not contain inflammatory or otherwise intemperate language.
Comments should ideally have been sent to the authors of the paper under discussion before submission to npj Biofilms and Microbiomes, so that disputes can be resolved directly whenever possible and points on which both parties agree removed from the submitted contribution. If an attempt to contact the original authors has been unsuccessful (for example, no response received after two weeks), this should be indicated at submission.
Any correspondence should accompany the submission as an attachment clearly labelled as 'Correspondence with the npj Biofilms and Microbiomes authors'.
Editorial process
The editors will decide how to proceed on the basis of the potential interest to readers, importance and timeliness of the contribution.

Matters Arising submissions that meet npj Biofilms and Microbiomes initial selection criteria are sent to the authors of the original paper for a formal response. The comments and formal response may then be sent to independent referees.

A Reply is published only when it adds to the debate, and not when it reiterates points already published. It should be confined to replying to the specific issue raised about the published paper.

Authors of the original npj Biofilms and Microbiomes publications must keep the information provided in Matters Arising confidential and must not use it for their own research or for any other purpose apart from replying to the comment.

We will not consider appeals against decisions not to publish Matters Arising unless the grounds for appeal consist of a previously overlooked and important scientific point and are clearly explained in these terms.

Please note that Formal Comments are not meant to address ethical issues—if you have ethical concerns about a PLOS Biology article, email our editorial office, plosbiology@plos.org.

Formal comments are considered exclusively by invitation. If you would like to be considered for an invitation to write a Formal Comment, please send your inquiry and a summary of the details via email to plosbiology@plos.org.

Formal Comments must be coherent, concise, and well-argued, and are subject to the PLOS Biology criteria for publication.

PLOS journal web sites provide the ability for users to comment on articles to facilitate community evaluation and discourse around published articles.

Comments should be used to make additions or clarifications, identify and link to material, and are designed to lead to threaded discussions concerning the content, conclusions, and consequences of a specific article.

Authors of all comments will be identified by their PLOS username.

Terms of Use
All comments and other post-publication activity in PLOS web sites are subject to the PLOS Terms of Use.

Who Can Contribute?
All registered users are able to add comments to any article. Anyone can register as a user. Users are required to unambiguously identify themselves with their first and last names, their geographic location, and a valid email address in order to register.

First and last name and geographic location are made public, however email addresses are private. The email address and other registration fields that the user chooses to make private will be kept strictly confidential by PLOS staff unless otherwise indicated. Discussion and ratings are not anonymous.

PLOS reserves the right to suspend the privileges of any registered user. Any registered user who is found to have provided false name or location information will have their account suspended and any postings deleted.

Adding and Viewing Comments
To add a comment about an article, first log into the web site. To create a comment, click the “Comments” tab at the top of the article. Click the “Post a new comment” link and enter a title and the text of the  comment in the appropriate boxes; completion of the competing interests statement is required.

Comments should be written in a word-processing program that allows for spell checking before they are copied and pasted into the comment field. Click “Post” to attach the comment to the article. Any correctly formed URLs in the comment text field will automatically become working links.

To view all comments on an article, along with any replies, click the “Comments” tab at the top of the article.

Responding to Comments
To respond to a comment, click the “Respond to this Posting” link in the bottom-right corner of the window. Enter a title and the text of the response in the appropriate boxes. Responses should be written in a word-processing program that allows for spell checking before they are copied and pasted into the comment field. Click “Post” to attach the response. Any correctly formed URLs in the response text field will automatically become working links.

Following this procedure, up to twelve branching threads can be anchored to an initial comment. If any contribution is removed following moderation, all subsequent responses along its thread will also be removed.

Good Practice
All contributions must conform to the norms of civilized scientific discussion. Any contributions that do not meet these standards will be removed. Any users who consistently transgress these conventions will have their user privileges removed.

A partial list of discussion standards includes the following:

Language that is insulting, inflammatory, or obscene will not be tolerated.
Unsupported assertions or statements should be avoided. Comments must be evidence-based, not authority-based.
When previously published studies are cited, they must be accurately referenced and, where possible, a DOI and link to a publicly accessible version supplied.
Unpublished data should be provided with sufficient methodological detail for those data to be assessed. Alternatively, a permanent web link to such information should be provided.
Arguments based on belief are to be avoided. For example the assertion, “I don't believe the results in Figure 2” must be supported.
Discussions should be confined to the demonstrable content of articles and should avoid speculation about the motivations or prejudices of authors.
Questions about experimental data are appropriate, but need to be phrased in a way that does not imply any misconduct on the part of the authors. If a reader is concerned about potential misconduct, such concerns must always be raised with senior editorial staff at PLOS. Contact the journal.
Concerned readers should not rely solely on posting their comments on blogs, social media, or other third party websites to make us aware of concerns, but should ensure to contact the journal directly.
PLOS is the final arbiter of the suitability of content for inclusion in PLOS web sites.

Flagging Inappropriate Content
Readers are encouraged to request review of a comment that does not adhere to PLOS Commenting Guidelines. To request review, click the  “Report a concern” link in the bottom-right corner of the window. Indicate why the content should be reviewed (“Spam,” “Offensive,” “Inappropriate,” or “Other”), enter additional information in the text box, and click “Submit”. PLOS staff will investigate the content, which may involve consulting external experts if necessary.

Any content that PLOS staff deem to be inappropriate will be removed. Any users who consistently post inappropriate material will have their user privileges removed. If any contribution is removed, all subsequent responses along its thread will also be removed.

TB,Scientific Reports,YES,Matters Arising,"Matters Arising
General information
Nature Research journals recognize the importance of post-publication commentary on published research as necessary to advancing scientific discourse. Formal post-publication commentary on published papers can involve either challenges, clarifications or in some cases, replication of the published work and may, after peer review, be published online as Matters Arising, usually alongside a Reply from the original Scientific Reports authors.

Matters Arising are exceptionally interesting and timely scientific comments and clarifications on original research papers published in Scientific Reports. These comments should ideally be based on knowledge contemporaneous with the original paper, rather than subsequent scientific developments.

If the submission serves only to identify an important error or mistake in the published paper, it will usually lead to the publication of a clarification statement (correction or retraction, for example). Please contact scientificreports@nature.com for these cases. Comments can also be posted on the journal’s website, under the full-text online version of the paper. Online posted comments can make reference to citable materials such as a preprint if necessary.

In all cases, Scientific Reports strongly encourages correspondents to first contact the authors of the paper directly as this can often resolve matters if it is a simple misunderstanding.

Matters Arising and Replies are bidirectionally linked with the original published paper. Scientific Reports does not consider Matters Arising on papers published in other journals. Contributions that do not comply with our submission criteria (see sections below) will not be considered.

Manuscript preparation and formatting
Before submission, correspondents may wish to read some previous contributions to see whether their contribution seems appropriate.

Manuscripts (both Matters Arising and Replies) should be formatted according to these instructions.

The main text should be as concise as possible, and ideally not exceed 1,200 words.
Contributions should start with a brief paragraph that summarizes the message of the article without specialized terminology, for a non-specialist readership. This paragraph should be used as the abstract for submission purposes.
Contributions should have a simple message that ideally requires only one or two small figures or tables.
At submission, figures should be of sufficient quality to be assessed by referees, ideally as JPEGs.
As a guideline, contributions may have up to 15 references; reference style is as for Articles.
Supplementary Information is permitted at the editor's discretion.
A competing interests statement is required.
An author contributions statement is required.","YES (provide number of words/comments below), 1200",NOT STATED,"YES (provide number of references below), 15",YES,YES (opens another page),Comments,"NA",NOT STATED,NOT STATED,NOT STATED,NOT STATED,NO (submits form),"NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"
